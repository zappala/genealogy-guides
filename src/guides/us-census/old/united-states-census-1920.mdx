title: "1920 United States Census"
---

We previously covered [the United States census for 1940](./united-states-census-1940) and [1930](./united-states-census-1930). We'll now cover United States census records from 1920, and we'll continue following my great-grandmother Daisy as in those previous examples.

## 1920 census

The 1920 census, like other censuses, tells where your family lived, how old they were, and who they lived with. In addition, it lists the immigration year and year of naturalization, the country where they and their parents were born, their native language and that of their parents, and their occupation. For additional details on the questions asked, see
[Questions Asked on the 1920 Census](https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions/1920_1.html).

Here is Daisy Campbell [in the 1920 census](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/6061/images/4293687-00480?pId=2343185):

Daisy, age 28, is married to James Campbell (31), and they have two children, Jean (6) and Kenneth (4 and 1 month). They are living at 1530 St. Charles in Alameda, Alameda, California. Here is what the house looks like today:

After the column that contains their ages and gender, you will see some columns that list their immigration date and naturalization status. For Daisy, the "Un" in immigration year indicates it is unknown, so whoever the census taker was interviewing may not have known it. Her naturalization status is "Na" for naturalized. James has an immigration year of 1907 and he was naturalized in 1915.

Next is a set of columns indicating whether the family members are in school and can read and write.

Moving to the right, we next see a section of the census that indicates where each family member was born and what language they speak, along with the same information for their mother and father. Daisy was born in England and speaks English, and the same for her parents. James was born in Ireland and his parents were both born in Scotland. This would be really helpful when tracing James Campbell's family! Knowing he is from Ireland, we might expect to see a long history with many generations there, as is typical for many immigrants, but in his case only one generation was in Ireland since his parents are from Scotland. The children were born in Connecticut, which could help us track down naturalization records for both James and Daisy.

Finally, the last part of the census shows James' occupation, which is silversmith, the industry where he worked, manufacturing, and his type of employment, which is "W" for wage.

## Summary
