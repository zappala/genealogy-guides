title: "1850 United States Census"

Let's go back even farther in the U.S. census, back to 1850. We will follow George Lawrence again, who we saw in the [1910](./united-states-census-1910), [1880](./united-states-census-1880), [1870](./united-states-census-1870), and [1860](./united-states-census-1860) United States Census.

## 1850 Census

For the 1870 and 1860 census, we used [a search on the census records at Ancestry, filling in "George H. Lawrence", an approximate birth year of 1845, a birth country of England, and listing Bridgeport, Connecticut as a place he lived](https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/35/?name=George+H_Lawrence&birth=1845_england-united+kingdom_3251&count=50&residence=_bridgeport-fairfield-connecticut-usa_56). We can then narrow this down by clicking `1850s` in the menu at left:

There is one good match for [George Lawrence living in Bridgeport, Connecticut](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/8054/images/4193073-00567?treeid=&personid=&rc=&usePUB=true&_phsrc=mgG11&_phstart=successSource&pId=18082081):

George is 6, living with his parents George, 28, and Anna, 30, and his sister Eliza and brother Alfred, 1. George Senior is a blacksmith. Alfred is listed as being born in Canada, with the rest born in England.

## Summary

We learn that George was in Bridgeport as early as 1850. We previously concluded he likely migrated to the United States between 1845 and 1849 so this is likely the earliest census where we will find him. It is curious that Alfred is listed as being born in Canada here; his birthplace was previously listed as New York in the 1860 and 1870 census. It's likely that Canada is a mistake, but it would be worth keeping in mind as we try to track this family's migration from England to the U.S. Knowing George Lawrence Senior's occupation could help us identify him in English records if he held the same job there.
