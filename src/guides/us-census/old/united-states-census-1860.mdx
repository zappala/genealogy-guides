title: "1860 United States Census"
---

We are continuing to go farther back in time, with less information available each time the census is taken. Let's examine the 1860 census records to see what they provide. We are again going to follow George Lawrence, who we saw in the [1910](./united-states-census-1910), [1880](./united-states-census-1880), and [1870](./united-states-census-1870) United States Census.

## 1860 Census

If we go back to our previous search for George Lawrence in all census records, and then click on the `1860s` link in the left menu, we can see [the records that Ancestry has matching that time period](https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/cen_1860/?name=George+H_Lawrence&birth=1845_england-united+kingdom_3251&count=50&residence=_bridgeport-fairfield-connecticut-usa_56):

Again there is only one likely match, given the information we know about George Lawrence. If we click [that record](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/7667/images/4211334_00254?treeid=&personid=&rc=&usePUB=true&_phsrc=mgG4&_phstart=successSource&pId=14746270), we see:

![1860 census george lawrence](./images/1860-census-george-lawrence.png)

George Lawrence, 16, is living with his parents, George Lawrence, 38, and Anna Lawrence, 40, and with his brother Alfred, 11. We can see that this matches well with the 1870 record, based on their ages, likely relatonships, and birth places. George Senior is a bellows maker and George is a carriage maker apprentice. Geoge Senior's estate is worth $1000 and his personal estate is worth $300.

Note that the Lawrence name has been spelled/indexed as Laurence here. Sometimes handwriting can make it difficult to distinguish these.

## Summary

As we track George back to 1860 we learn that he was trained as a carriage maker's apprentice before later working in a sewing factory. We are close to exhausting what the United States Census has for George and should next try to make the jump to England where he was born.
