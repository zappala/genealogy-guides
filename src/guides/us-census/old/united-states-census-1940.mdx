title: "1940 United States Census"
---

If your ancestors lived in the United States, the census is a great way to find additional information about them. Even if you know who all of your ancestors are, the census can help you learn more about their stories.

It is especially helpful if you can go backward in time through the census, since this is the easiest way to conduct research on your family, from most recent to more distant events. We'll cover census records from the 20th century in that order. Law in the United States allows census records to be made public after 72 years. This means the most recent available census is 1940, so we'll start there.

I like to use [Ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com/) to look up census records.

## 1940 census

The 1940 census can show you where your family lived, how old they were, who they lived with, their amount of schooling, where they were born, where they worked, and how much they earned. For additional details on the questions asked, see
[Questions Asked on the 1940 Census](https://1940census.archives.gov/questions-asked.asp).

Here is Daisy Turner, one of my great grandmothers, [in the 1940 census](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/2442/images/m-t0627-00500-00384?pId=133804430):

Daisy J Turner is married to Thomas Turner, with daughters Francis M. and Patricia D. You can see that they are listed as step-daughters of Thomas Turner, and a surname of Campbell is written in for Francis. This would be a clue to look into her first marriage, and other census records may tell us more. (It's not clear from the census whether Francis or Patricia used the Campbell surname since they both also have the horizontal line indicating the same last name as their step-father.) The X with a circle next to Daisy's name indicates she is the one the census taker interviewed.

The family is living at 421 Allyndale Drive in Stratfield, Fairfield, Connecticut. Note the street name is written sideways on the left side of the page. They own their home, and it is valued at $2,500. Here is how the home looks today:

Daisy and Thomas are both 51, Francis is 14 and Patricia is 11. Thomas attended up to 5th grade, Daisy and Francis 8th grade, and Patricia 5th. Thomas and Patricia were both born in England, with the daughters born in Illinois. Both Daisy and Thomas are naturalized citizens. The last boxes on the far right indicate they were living in the same house in 1935.

Moving over to the right, the rest of the census page shows that Thomas is working at a private firm during the week of March 24th-30th. He worked 40 hours as a carpenter in a brass factory. He worked 52 weeks during 1939 and earned $1456. The last column indicates he had income from other sources that was greater than $50.

Daisy was not working at a private firm, was doing housework, and her occupation was a dramatic teacher at a private school. She worked 0 weeks in 1939 but did have other income.

## Summary

We know a lot about Daisy and her family now. Imagine we had been starting from scratch to learn more about her. The census tells us:

- She was born in England about 1889,
- She has been naturalized as a citizen of the United States,
- She has been married twice, with her second marriage to Thomas Turner,
- She has at least two children, Francis, and Patricia, and
- She has lived in Connecticut and Illinois.

We also know some details about her husband and his employment.
