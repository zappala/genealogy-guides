title: "1840 United States Census and earlier"
---

The 1840 United States Census and earlier years contain significantly less information that later census records. They generally record just the name of the head of a household and some statistics about their property and others living in the household. Let's take a look at a record from 1840 to see what it contains.

## 1840 Census

The 1840 United States census has significantly different information in it than later years. Following is an example record of the 1840 census from Bridgeport, Connecticut:

This census records only the names of the head of each family, then counts the number of "free white males and females" in each age group, from under 5 years of age to over 100 years of age. Next it counts the number of "free colored persons" in various age groups, the number of slaves in various age groups, the number of persons in each family employed in various industries, the name and age of pensioners for Revolutionary or military service and then additional questions medical conditions and schoolng. See the full [set of questions](https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions/1840_1.html) in the 1840 census.

This census captures some of the statistics telling the horrific tragedy of our country's history with slavery. More information on slaves is listed in the 1850 and 1860 census records, which track slaves on a separate slave schedule.

## 1790 Census

The United States census began in 1790. It recorded the name of the head of a household plus (1) the number of free white males aged under 16 years and 16 years and older, (2) the number of free white females, (3) the number of other free persons, and (4) the number of slaves.

Below is an example of a 1790 census record taken from Bridgeport Connecticut:

## Summary

Tracking your family in the 1840 census and earlier records is difficult, because only the head of household is mentioned. You will need to try to correlate the counts listed for different ages with the people you see later census records and other available records. This requires building up evidence carefully, from a variety of sources.
