title: "1910 United States Census"
---

We previously covered [the United States census for 1940](./united-states-census-1940), [1930](./united-states-census-1930), and [1920](./united-states-census-1920). We'll now cover United States census records from 1910, and we'll continue following my great-grandmother Daisy as in those previous examples.

## 1910 census

The 1910 census tells where your family lived, how old they were, and who they lived with. In addition, it lists their birthplace and the birthplace for each of their parents, along with their immigration year and naturalization status. It also lists their occupation, whether they are out of work, number of weeks worked, whether they own or rent their home, whether they live on a farm, and whether they are a veteran. For additional details on the questions asked, see
[Questions Asked on the 1910 Census](https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions/1910_1.html).

Here is [Daisy in the 1910 census](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/7884/images/31111_4327332-00644?pId=187411251):

You can see some interesting things in this census. First, Daisy's maiden name is Juchaw (other records show this is correctly spelled Juchau). Daisy is living with the Lawrence family, George H., 65, Emma A., 60, and their daughter Emma A, 22. Minnie V. Juchaw, 18, and her sister, Dazie M. Juchaw, 22, are neices of George Lawrence. Living with an uncle is somewhat unusual, and this could be for a variety of reasons. Exploring this requires looking at other records later.

The family is living at 260 Nichols Street, Bridgeport, Fairfield, Connecticut. The home is no longer there today -- Interstate 95 was built through the backyards of the homes, so that could explain it.

We next reach a few things in the 1910 census that are different from 1920. First, it lists "M1" for the marital status, indicating that George and Emma Lawrence have each been married once (to each other). It also shows the number of years they have been married -- 40. Finally, it lists how many children have been born to a mother and how many are still living. Emma had 12 children, with 5 living.

Moving to the right, we see George and Emma Lawrence were both born in England, as were their parents. Their daughter Emma was born in Connecticut, while Minnie and Dazie were both born in England, as were their parents. George immigrated in 1849 and is Naturalized. His wife Emma immigrated in 1869, Minnie came in 1899, and Dazie came in 1900. Note that immigration dates can be wrong because they rely on the memory of the person being interviewed, so these should be double-checked with immigration records. They can also be cross-checked with other census records.

In the last part of the census we see that George is a machinist in a factory and earning a wage. He is out of work as of April 15th and was out of work for 24 weeks in 1909. His wife Emma does not work and his daughter Emma is a press hand at a factory, earning a wage, and currently working. Minnie is a stenographer at a beef company, earning a wage, and currently working. Dazie is a winder at a plush shop (a shop that sells stuffed animals). She was not out of work as of April 15th, but was out of work for 8 weeks in 1909. All of them can read and write, and Minnie attended some school in 1909.

George owns their home free, with no mortgage, and it is a house (not a farm).

The last numbers you see written here are not recording data for the listed column names but were used when entering the data from the census onto punch cards for tabulation.

## How do we know this is the right Daisy?

When searching backwards for women in the census, finding the right person as a child can be difficult if you don't know their maiden name. Imagine we knew only my grandmother's married name -- Daisy Campbell (1st marriage) or Daisy Turner (2nd marriage). How would we know she was Daisy Juchau in the 1910 census and not some other Daisy?

The first step might be [searching the 1910 census with what we know](https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/cen_1910/?name=daisy&event=_england-united+kingdom_3251&birth=1892&count=50&residence=_bridgeport-fairfield-connecticut-usa_56) -- first name Daisy, born around 1892 in England, living in Bridgeport, Fairfield, Connecticut. With a name like Daisy, the first record in this result is the right one and also clearly the best match. But without other information it can be hard to be sure this is correct, and with more common first names there may be many reasonable matches.

In this case, the best thing to do is to try to find a marriage record, which would usually list the bride's maiden name. On Ancestry, you can [search for a marriage record](https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/bmd_marriage/?name=Daisy&birth=1892_England-United+Kingdom&count=50&marriage=1915&marriage_x=5-0-0&residence=_bridgeport-fairfield-connecticut-usa_56&spouse=James_Campbell) given what we know -- first name Daisy, born around 1892 in England, lived in Bridgeport, Fairfield Connecticut, and married James Campbell in 1915, plus or minus 5 years:

The third and fourth results are strong matches. The first is a marriage to a James Cunningham, the second is a marriage to a James Raynor. The third and fourth results are for the same marriage of a Daisy M Juchan to a James C Campbell. We know their oldest child, Jean, was born about 1914, so a 1912 marriage makes sense. We could order this marriage record from New York City, and by matching information on this record with information about James Campbell, could ascertain that this is the right person.

Finally, sometimes the easiest thing to do is to confirm information with a living relative. Talk to your parents and grandparents to find out what they know!

In my case, I know Daisy's maiden name from talking to relatives and have also obtained marriage records confirming this relationship.

## Summary

Let's combine what we know from the previous census records, 1940, 1930, and 1920, with what we have learned here.

- Daisy was born Daisy Juchau in England between 1888 and 1895 -- with the three earliest census records being roughly in agreement with a birth year of 1888, 1889, or 1892.
- She emigrated to the United States in 1900 or 1902 and has been naturalized as a citizen of the United States.
- She lived in Connecticut with her uncle before being married.
- She married her first husband, James Campbell, between 1910 and 1920 and lived with him in Alameda, California and Aurora Illinois.
- She has at least four children, Jean, Kenneth, Francis, and Patricia, all from her first marriage.
- She married Thomas Turner between 1930 and 1940 and lived with him in Connecticut.

If we were doing more research on Daisy, the next steps would be to look at the 1900 census, which would help narrow down an immigration date, as well as immigration records and English birth records.
