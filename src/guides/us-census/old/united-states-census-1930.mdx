title: "1930 United States Census"

We are going to continue looking at my great-grandmother Daisy, this time in the 1930 United States census. We previously learned about her in the [1940 census](./1940-census).

As we continue going backward, we want to be sure we are following the same person or family through time. We will also learn more about them and be able to get a more complete picture of their lfe.

We will again use [Ancestry.com](https://www.ancestry.com/) to look up census records.

## 1930 Census

The 1930 census includes much of the same information as the 1930 census, but also shows where your relatives' parents were born, what year they immigrated to the United States, and whether they were a military veteran.
For additional details on the questions asked, see
[Questions Asked on the 1930 Census](https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions/1930_1.html).

Here is Daisy in the [1930 census](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/6224/images/4584604_00588?pId=26617998):

She is Daisy Campbell at the time, married to James Campbell, with daughters Jean, Francis, and Patricia, and a son Kenneth. They also have John Coufal, a roomer, living with them. The family is living at 470 North Lake Street (the street is higher on the page) in Aurora, Kane, Illinois. They are renting their home for $55/month and they own a radio set. Here is how the home looks today:

Daisy is 35, James is 42, Jean is 16, Kenneth is 14, Francis is 4 and 5 months, and Patricia is 1 and 10 months. Daisy was born in England and her parents are listed as being born in France and England. Daisy, James, Jean, and Kenneth can all read and write, and the two older children are in school.

On the right side of the page we see that James and his parents were born in Ireland. Both Jean and Kenneth were born in Connecticut, while Francis and Patricia were born in Illinois. Before coming to the United States, Daisy spoke English and James spoke Irish. Daisy reported coming to the United States in 1902 and James in 1905. Both are naturalized (abbreviated as Na). Next, James is listed as being employed as a superintendent at a silverplate company.
This industry is coded as 7332. You can [look up occupation codes](https://stevemorse.org/census/ocodes.htm) at Steve Morse's website.

On the far right, you can see a notation ("No") that James is not a veteran.

## Summary

Combining what we have found in 1930 and 1940, so far the census tells us these things about Daisy:

- She was born in England likely between 1889 and 1895,
- She emigrated to the United States in about 1902,
- She has been naturalized as a citizen of the United States,
- She has been married twice, to James Campbell and Thomas Turner,
- She has at least four children, Jean, Kenneth, Francis, and Patricia.
- She has lived in Connecticut and Illinois.

We also know some details about her husbands and their employment.

Finally, a few words about dates and ages. These are not necessarily accurate! These are based on whoever reported the information, and they may not know or remember the dates and ages correctly. For example, Daisy is listed as 51 in 1940 and then 35 in 1930. The best way to resolve these discrepancies is to do some further research. Our next steps would be to find her records in the 1920 and 1910 census and to find her immigration record.
