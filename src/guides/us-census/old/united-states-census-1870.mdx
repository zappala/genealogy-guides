title: "1870 United States Census"
---

As we get farther back in time, the United States census begins to include less information. Let's examine the 1870 census records to see what they provide. We are going to follow George Lawrence, who we saw in the the [1910 United States Census](./united-states-census-1910) and the [1880 United States Census](./united-states-census-1880).

## 1870 Census

As we search the census backward in time, we need to be sure we have the correct person. Let's review what we know about George Lawrence from the 1880 census:

- George Lawrence, 35, was married to his wife Emma, 29, with children Alfred, 10, Harry, 8, and George W, 4.
- The family lived at 99 Hallam Street in Bridgeport, Fairfield County, Connecticut.
- George worked in a sewing machine factory.
- George and Emma were born in England, and their children were all born in Connecticut.

As we go back 10 years, George and Emma may not be married yet. Their [1900 census record](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/7602/images/4118691_00539?usePUB=true&usePUBJs=true&pId=6950709) indicates they were married 30 years at that point, right about 1870, and the birth of their first child, Alfred, must have come shortly after that if he was 10 years old in 1880. So we may find them married without children in the 1870 census, married and with a young Alfred, or not yet married. We would expect to find them in Connecticut since all their children were born there.

My first step is to [conduct a search on the census records at Ancestry, filling in "George H. Lawrence", an approximate birth year of 1845, a birth country of England, and listing Bridgeport, Connecticut as a place he lived](https://www.ancestry.com/search/categories/35/?name=George+H_Lawrence&birth=1845_england-united+kingdom_3251&count=50&residence=_bridgeport-fairfield-connecticut-usa_56). Here are the first few search results:

The second result looks promising, but I recommend first narrowing down the search to the 1870 census, since that's what we're focused on. You can do this by clicking `1870s` in the menu at left.

Ancestry does a good job of putting the most relevant results at the top, and you can see the first result (the same as the second one in the previous search) is our best match. Here is what that record shows:

![1870 census george lawrence](./images/1870-census-george-lawrence.png)

Is this the right person? George H. Lawrence is 25, working in a sewing machine factory, and was born in England. All of this fits perfectly with the 1880 census. Another person living in this household is Emma Lawrence, 19, born in England, which also matches with the 1880 census. Since this census does not list marriage status or relationships we have to make some assumptions here. Given that all this information matches, and there was no other obvious match for George in Connecticut, it is likely this is the same George and Emma we saw in the 1880 census as husband and wife. We could go a step farther, find their marriage records, and, if we can find Emma's maiden name, see if we can find her living with her parents in 1870 to try to rule this out as her. But given what we know so far, this is a pretty solid match.

What else does this census tell us? George's parents are George Lawrence, 49, and Emma Lawrence, 52, with a brother Alfred E., 21. George Senior works at a pump factory, Anna is performing domestic duties, and Alfred is working in a sewing factory. Their home is worth $250 and their personal estate is worth $150. Everyone was born in England, except Alfred, who was born in New York.

This gives us some additional helpful information. Since George, 25, was born in England, and Alfred, 21, was born in New York, we can narrow down the immigration of the family the the years 1845 to 1849. Notice that unlike the later United States Census records we have covered, there is no immigration year listed, so we have to figure it out with clues like this.

Finally, notice there is some additional information possible in this census. There is space for birth month and marriage month, though those are not listed for this family. There are columns for whether a person is attending school, cannot read or write, has a medical condition, is a male over the age of 21, and was denied voting.

This last question was particularly important, given the end of the Civil War and the ratification of [the 14th Amendment](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-14/). This [article from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/the-long-history-of-the-us-government-asking-americans-whether-they-are-citizens.html) explains the situation:

> When a citizenship question returned 40 years later, in the 1870 census, it was part of a baldly political scheme to address one consequence of the Civil War: Newly freed slaves had so expanded the population of the former Confederate states that the South was expected to gain 15 House seats in the reapportionment of 1871.

> The prospect that the defeated Southern states might actually be able to control both the House of Representatives and the Electoral College so alarmed Republicans that they included a clause in the new 14th Amendment to prevent it. Because Southern states were denying voting rights to freed slaves, the clause reduced the population base used to allot House seats, based on how many adult male citizens in a state had been denied the right to vote.

> Implementing that clause required adding a question about the citizenship status of adult males to the 1870 census, as well as a question about whether those citizens had been denied voting rights. But by the time the census took place, the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed voting rights to African-Americans, made the provision moot — and as the census soon showed, a population surge in the American West offset the South’s gains anyway.

## Summary

As we go farther back, there is less information in the census, but we have been able to track George Lawrence from 1910 back to 1880 and 1870. We now know who his parents were -- George and Anna Lawrence -- and that his family immigrated from England between 1845 and 1849. We know he married Emma shortly before 1870. We know he has a brother Alfred and that he and Emma have children Alfred, Harry, George, and Emma. We didn't examine this family in the 1900 census, but [the census record in 1900](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/7602/images/4118691_00539?treeid=&personid=&rc=&usePUB=true&_phsrc=mgG7&_phstart=successSource&pId=6950709) shows they also have children Elizabeth, Alice, and Arthur.
