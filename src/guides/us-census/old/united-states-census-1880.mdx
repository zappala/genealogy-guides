title: "1880 United States Census"
---

You may notice we skipped the 1890 census. This is because [nearly all records of this census were destroyed in a 1921 fire](https://www.census.gov/history/www/genealogy/decennial_census_records/availability_of_1890_census.html).

Because of the loss of the 1890 census, the 1880 census is particularly important. Here we will look at George and Emma Lawrence, the uncle and aunt of Daisy Juchau, who we covered in the 1900 through 1940 censuses.

## 1880 Census

In addition to telling where your family lived, how old they were, and who they lived with, the census also lists a persons race in a few categories (White, Black, Mulatto, Chinese (East Asian), and American Indian), their occupation and months employed that year, whether they were sick or disabled, their birthplace, and the birthplaces of their parents. For additional details on the questions asked, see
[Questions Asked on the 1880 Census](https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/index_of_questions/1880_1.html).

Here are [George and Emma Lawrence in the 1880 census](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/6742/images/4240007-00748?treeid=&personid=&hintid=&usePUB=true&usePUBJs=true&pId=44607802):

George H. Lawrence, 35, and his wife Emma, 29, live with their children Alfred, 10, Harry, 8, and George W., 4. The family lives at 99 Hallam Street, Bridgeport, Fairfield County, Connecticut. This location has been redeveloped since then, but you can see where it was located in the map below. Hallam Street is just above Hamilton Street, running toward Yellow Mill Pond.

George Lawrence works in a sewing machine factory ("Works Sew'g M. Fcty."), Emma keeps house, and Alfred is at school. George was out of work for 6 months this year.

The rest of the census enumerates various conditions the family may have (sick, blind, deaf and dumb, idiotic, insane, disabled), whether they attended school (Alfred and Harry), and whether they are unable to read or write. It then lists their birthplace, along with the birthplace of their mother and father. George and Emma were born in England, as were their parents. The children were all born in Connecticut.

## Summary

We previously saw George and Emma Lawrence in the [1910 United States Census)(./united-states-census-1910). Combining that record with this one, we know the following things about the Lawrence family:

- George Lawrence was born about 1845 in England and his wife Emma (maiden name not known), was born about 1850 or 1851, also in England.
- The 1910 census indicates they were married for 40 years (so married in about 1870). In the 1880 census their oldest child is 10, so they likely married about 1869. Since their children were born in Connecticut, it is possible they married in Connecticut.
- The 1910 census indicates that George immigrated to the U.S. in 1849 and Emma in 1869. They must have married soon after she came to the U.S., or they may have married in England and then came to the U.S. to have their first child.
- They have children Alfred (born about 1870), Harry (1872), George W. (1876), and Emma A. (1888). Because of the 30 year gap in census records, there are likely other children we have missed.
- George worked in a sewing machine factory in 1880 and as a machinist in a factory in 1910, so his career appears to have been mostly in the industrial sector.

Some of the next steps, were we to investigate this family more, would be to find them in additional census, starting with 1900 and looking also at 1920 onward. We can likewise go backward in the census to 1870. We would certainly cwant to look for immigration records and birth records in England. Finally, we would want to try to find a marriage record and find Emma's maiden name so we could track her family as well.
