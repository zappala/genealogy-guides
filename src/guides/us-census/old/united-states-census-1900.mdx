title: "1900 United States Census"
---

We previously covered the United States census for [1940](./united-states-census-1940), [1930](./united-states-census-1930), [1920](./united-states-census-1920), and [1910](./united-states-census-1910). We'll now cover United States census records from 1900, and we'll continue following my great-grandmother Daisy as in those previous examples.

## 1900 census

The 1900 census, like other censuses, tells where your family lived, how old they were, and who they lived with. In addition, it lists the birth month and birth year for each resident, something other United States census records don't have. It also lists how many years someone has been married, how many children a woman has had and how many are still living, the birthplace of each resident as well as their parents' birthplaces, their immigration year and naturalization status, their occupation, literacy, and home ownership.

Here is Daisy Juchau [in the 1900 census](https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/7602/images/4118691_00535?pId=6950477):

Daisy is living with the Cook family, Thomas S., 49, Mariam, 47, and their children Lilliam S., 19, Ivy Rose, 16, Thomas S., and 7. Daisy Juchau, 11, Thomas C. Juchau, 10, and Marie Juchau, 7, are nieces and nephews of Thomas Cook. In the 1920 census Daisy and Minnie were living with a different uncle, George Lawrence, so there is likely an interesting story here.

The family is living at 50 Cedar Street in Bridgeport, Fairfield, Connecticut. This is what is at the location today, but it may not be the same house:

Notice that to the right of Sex is the birth month and year for each person -- Thomas in March 1851, Mariam in November 1852, Lilliam in August 1881, Ivy Rose in April 1884, Thomas Jr. in March 1893, Daisy in September 1888, Thomas Juchau in May 1890, and Minnie in December 1892. This is really useful information, as it could help us track down additional records for the family. Knowing the birth month and year is particularly helpful for English birth records.

Next to this we see that Thomas and Mariam Cook have been married for 30 years and Mariam had 7 children, with 3 currently living.

The next columns list the birth places for everyone and their parents -- these are all England. Everyone is listed as having immigrated in 1899, and Thomas Cook has not been naturalized (the "Al" stands for alien).

Thomas is a bricklayer and was not employed for 3 months in the last year. His daughters Lilliam and Ivy Rose stitch corsets and were out of work 11 months last year. Daisy and Thomas Juchau attended school for 4 months last year. Everyone can read, write, and speak English and the family is renting a house.

## Summary

We can combine what we learned about Daisy Juchau from the 1900 census with our previous look at her :

- We had previously found that her birth year was likely 1888, 1889, or 1992, and the 1900 census tells us she was born in September 1888.
- We previously thought she immigrated from England in 1900 or 1902. This is unlikely since she was in America in the 1900 census, and this census tells us she immigrated in 1899.
- She likely came directly to Connecticut to live with her uncle and aunt, Thomas and Miriam Cook, before moving in with her other uncle and aunt, George and Emma Lawrence, before 1910.

This gives us some excellent information track down both her immigration record and her birth record in England.

We could track both the Cook and Lawrence families in England. Since the Lawrence family was in America in 1880, they came much earlier than the Cook family did in 1899. Tracking the family in England could be helpful since they probably lived near the Juchau family there.
