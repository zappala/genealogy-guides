## FamilySearch

There are many free resources available on the
[FamilySearch website](https://www.familysearch.org/en/), with billions of historic records available.
Their library catalog is the definitive source of records, including vast arrays of books and microfilms.
Many microfilms are being digitized and indexed, with diverse records from around the world.
You can also participate in created a shared family tree that covers all of humanity.
Members of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/) can use this site to request temple ordinances for their ancestors.

If you are a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, you may
already have an account with one of their websites or apps. This includes the
[church website](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng) and the
[Gospel Library and Member tools apps](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/pages/mobileapps?lang=eng).

  <h3>Are you a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints?</h3>

You will need your membership number. The easiest way to get this is from your
profile on the Member Tools app or your temple recommend. You can also ask your
ward clerk or a member of your bishopric and they can look it up for you.

to temple ordinances that members perform.
