These guides provide introductory information on a variety of topics related to family history or genealogy. Each guide is intended to be a short, hands-on instruction in a particular area of research. From there, we provide additional resources where you can learn more.

If you have questions or suggestions for a guide you would like us to write, please contact us at `guides@zappala.org`.

## December 2020 Update

We are launching the website this month! We are starting with some guides on how to get involved in family history work,
along with introductions on immigration, the United States census, and Italian research.
