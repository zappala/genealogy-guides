title: "Why genealogy?"
---

You may wonder why you should care about ancestors you have never known, or why
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints spend so much time learning about their family history. Following are a few resources on this topic.

## To connect with our families

Connecting with our family can bring joy and make sorrows easier to bear. Genealogy includes making new memories with our families, as well as connecting with more distant relatives and learning about those who came long before us.

## To bless our ancestors

> God’s objective should be our objective. He wants His children to choose to return to Him, prepared, qualified, endowed, sealed, and faithful to covenants made in holy temples.

-- [President Russell M. Nelson, General Conference April 2019](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2019/04/57nelson?lang=eng)

As members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, we believe that every person can receive the
blessings of the gospel, including baptism and eternal marriage, even if they never had a chance to be baptized while they were alive.
It remains their choice whether to accept the ordinance.

## To receive promised blessings

Our prophets and apostles have promised numerous blessings as we spend time learning about our ancestors. These include more closeness and joy in our families, divine protection, and a deeper conversion to Jesus Christ.
